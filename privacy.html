              your personal information, searches, or other communications will

            <h6>Your Rights and Choices</h6>
            <p>
              As a California resident you have certain rights with respect to
              the personal information collected by businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to Access.</strong> You have the right to receive
              information about the types of personal information that the
              Company collects, uses, discloses, and sells. Specifically, this
              right allows you to ask the Company for the following information:
              (a) the categories of personal information that the Company
              collects about you; (b) the categories of sources from which the
              Company has obtained personal information about you; (c) the
              Company's business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling
              your personal information; (d) the categories of your personal
              information that the Company sells to third parties; (e) the
              categories of third parties that the Company sells your personal
              information to; and (f) the specific pieces of personal
              information that the Company has collected about you. The Company
              must disclose this information to you when you exercise your right
              to know, subject to proper verification of your request.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to be Forgotten.</strong> You have the right to
              request that the Company delete any personal information it has
              collected or maintains about you, subject to certain exceptions
              for business purposes outlined in the applicable law. Once the
              Company receives and confirms your verifiable consumer request,
              the Company will delete your personal information from its
              records, unless an exception applies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> You have the right
              to non-discrimination if you exercise any of your rights under the
              CCPA. If you exercise your rights under the CCPA, the Company,
              pertaining to its good and services, will not do any of the
              following: (a) deny you any goods or services; (b) charge you a
              different price or rate for goods or services, including through
              the use of benefits or imposing penalties; (c) provide to you a
              different level or quality of goods or services; or (d) suggest to
              you that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or
              services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> You have the right to direct
              the Company to not sell your personal information to third parties
              at any time. The Company only shares information as outlined
              herein. If you choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal
              information, the Company will no longer send your personal
              information to third parties. You can choose, at any time, to opt

              verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
              You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
              minor child.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know or for
              access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
              request must: (1) Provide sufficient information that allows the
              Company to reasonably verify you are (a) the person about whom the
              Company collected personal information or (b) such person's
              authorized representative. (2) Describe your request with
              sufficient detail that allows the Company to properly understand,
              evaluate, and respond to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may require additional information to verify your requests to
              exercise your rights or understand the scope of your request,
              although you will not be required to create any account on RETBATE
              INVESTMENTS LTD to submit a request or have it fulfilled. The
              Company cannot respond to your request or provide you with
              personal information if the Company cannot verify your identity or
              authority to make the request and confirm the personal information
              relates to you. The Company will only use personal information
              provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
              requestor's identity or authority to make the request. We are
              permitted to reject your request if we reasonably determined that
              you are not a resident of the State of California.
            </p>
            <h6>Response Timing and Format</h6>
            <p>
              We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45
              days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we
              will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If
              you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response
              to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will
              deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
              option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month
              period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The
              response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply
              with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we
              will select a format to provide your personal information that is
              readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information
              from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
              consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
              unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
              will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a
              cost estimate before completing your request.
            </p>
